        <p>One day late, not too bad</p>
        <p>
          So, this week I started the frontend module, and, I'm not going to
          lie, feels a more exciting then when I started the backend module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing that I'm excited about, is the fact that I've also
          applied for my first tech role! And not only that, I've got another 2
          jobs that I'm going to apply to, too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Going back to the course...We are learning the react framework, and my
          understanding is it's like mixing JavaScript and HTML to create
          components/UI for a website/application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first project, as part of the frontend module, is to create a
          weather app. The thing that I find more 'exciting' about the frontend,
          when comparing to the backend, is that it's just more visual. For
          example, in the backend, you create a new endpoint, so that you can
          enter data into a database. So then, you can send a post/put request
          with the data, and then it'll post/put the data into a database. And
          to me that's just not as exciting as making text appear on a webpage,
          and then styling it. Nonetheless, I see the value in learning the
          skills that were taught in the backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to keep it short this week, as I'm very busy with creating
          the weather app (which I'll demo in the next post), as well as getting
          job applications ready!
