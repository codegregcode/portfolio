          This is my first post since 10/02, which means I missed posting last
          week, but I’ve got a good excuse. On Sunday 19th I moved house!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the time since my last post I started the main project for this
          module called music library. I was making good progress up to the
          Wednesday before the move, because at that point I started packing my
          stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of the move I fell behind with my coursework. After the
          best part of the week of no coding, I went to class on Monday, and
          never felt so overwhelmed. I spent the majority of the lecture
          worrying about being behind. And the majority of the free supported
          study time I spent trying to get back to speed with what code I’d
          written for the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the move was done, I still had to unpack, so until
          Thursday (yesterday) I was still unpacking! Finally, yesterday, I made
          some good progress on the music library project, and I’m nearly
          finished, I just need to finish adding albums.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing that I'm excited about where I'm now living is that they're
          much closer to a very nice walk that I like to do in Leeds, so I’m
          keen to get back out, and getting some fresh air in my lungs!

          So over the past two weeks, it feels like I’ve moved, stopped moving,
          and back moving again, both physically and with work! I've still got
          to add albums to my music database, and finish of another project that
          we started during Wednesday's class called 'Have I Fed The Cat?', but
          I feel much more on track than I did last Friday, or even yesterday
          morning!
