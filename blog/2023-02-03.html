          I started this blog to keep track of my progress whilst on the Command
          Shift fast track software development course. I initially tried to
          keep track on Twitter using #100daysofcode, but it wasn't working out
          as I wasn't into Twitter and found it hard to remember to add to it
          daily.

          My name is Greg and I'm from Devon, but currently living in Leeds.
          After graduating from Leeds College of Music with a degree in music
          performance, I played in function bands at weddings and events.
          However, I preferred to play my own music, which didn't pay as much as
          playing in function bands. I then worked in a bank, but the inflexible
          hours made it hard for me to take time off for gigs. So, I quit and
          became a teaching assistant in a school. This gave me the perfect
          balance of time off at weekends and during the summer for gigs and
          festivals with my band, Mansion of Snakes!

          After a few years, I wanted to make more money and obtained a TEFL
          qualification to teach English as a foreign language from home. I
          moved back to Leeds in August 2020, and when I did that, the TEFL wage
          went down and bookings disappeared, so I got a job as a playworker and
          a teaching assistant in a school.

          Feeling stuck in a rut, and not playing any gigs, I decided to start
          coding during the summer of 2022. I began with myfreecodecamp,
          learning HTML and CSS and then JavaScript. A friend recommended that I
          join a bootcamp, so I chose Command Shift (then known as Manchester
          Codes) due to its part-time schedule, good reviews, and students
          moving into tech jobs quickly after graduating.

          I joined the October 2022 cohort and was nervous at first, but quickly
          felt at ease. The course started with learning CLI, git, HTML and CSS,
          and having a tutor and other students around was helpful. The next
          module was JavaScript basics and things started to get a bit more
          challenging. But, I enjoyed the challenge, especially building virtual
          pets and cruise ships applications! Nevertheless, I'm eager to keep
          progressing through the course and excited to see where it takes me.
