          I’ve started this blog, as a way to keep track on how I’m progressing
          through Command Shift fast track software dev course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I initially started keeping track on twitter using the #100daysofcode,
          but I’ve never really been into twitter, and trying to remember to add
          to it everyday just wasn’t happening.
        </p>
        <p>So, that’s why I’ve started this blog!</p>
        <p>
          I’m going to set myself 1 hour a week to write up what I’ve been up
          to! But for this post I’m going to give a quick overview of who I am,
          what I’ve done and how I’ve found the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Greg, and I’m originally from Devon, but currently living
          in Leeds. I moved up here to study music performance at Leeds College
          of Music. After graduating I spent some time playing in function bands
          at weddings and different events etc. However, I never really enjoyed
          playing the types of events where you have to play other people’s
          music, I’d much rather play my own. Unfortunately, for me, people will
          pay you much more money to play ‘Uptown Funk’ or ‘Mr Brightside’, than
          for playing own, so if I was to stop playing functions/weddings, then
          I’d need a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had no idea what I wanted to do ‘job wise’, and spent a few months
          working for a bank. And although the pay was good, the hours were not
          flexible. I was having to take more and more time off so I could play
          gigs. Then, when I had a full summer schedule of festivals, and I
          couldn’t take any more time off, I quit. I saw a job advert for
          working in a school, and the more I thought about it the more I
          thought that a school job (as a teaching assistant) would work well
          around my schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I went from working in a bank, to working in a school, and the
          first thing I noticed was the difference in pay! However, I could get
          over that, as the freedom of having weekends and evening consistently
          free to gig kept me happy enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did this for a few years, and eventually the lack of financial
          reimbursement was getting to me. I did some research and found out
          that you could make a decent wage teaching English as a foreign
          language from home! I decided to concentrate on my studies back in
          Devon, and got my TEFL qualification and started teaching. The
          flexibility of teaching from anywhere with an internet connection was
          great, and I was getting good money for (what seemed to me) very easy
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few months in Devon I wanted to move back to Leeds. So I moved
          back up August 2020, and to supplement my income I got a job as a
          playworker in a school. Shortly after moving back to Leeds the TEFL
          wage went down, then the bookings started disappearing. I found out,
          after looking online, that many of these companies over hired during
          the pandemic, and coupled with rules in China about teaching children
          outside of school hours, the work stopped. Luckily, as I was working
          in a school as playworker (for an after school club) I was quickly
          able to get a job as teaching assistant. The exact job I left two
          years prior, just in a different school.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pay was never very good in a school, and that hadn’t changed. In
          fact, the wage hadn’t changed at all, and as it hadn’t risen with
          inflation, it’s actually been cut! Also, during covid my band went on
          an indefinite hiatus due to members having babies and moving
          countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m still currently working at the school, but without the gigs
          keeping me happy, I’ve felt stuck in a rut. At the beginning of the
          summer holiday in 2022, I decided that I was going to do something
          that I’d be recommend to do back when I moved to Devon, coding!
        </p>
        <p>
          My coding journey began by signing up to myfreecodecamp, and going
          through the HTML and CSS course, which I really enjoyed! Then it was
          onto the JavaScript one and I enjoyed that too! A good friend of mine
          recommend that I join a bootcamp, as that was what they’d done and it
          had been life changing for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are lots of lots of results when you search for ‘coding bootcamp
          uk’, and I spent a lot of time looking at different prospectuses
          before deciding on Command Shift (then known as Manchester Codes).
        </p>
        <p>
          The things that drew me to Command Shift, were that it was part time,
          it had lots of good reviews and a lots of students moving into tech
          quickly after graduating!
        </p>
        <p>So I joined the October 2022 cohort!</p>
        <p>
          I was slightly nervous when it came to the first lecture, but that
          quickly disappeared a few minutes into the class. After a few ice
          breaking exercises we got into the course proper, which started with
          learning about CLI, git, HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I had done the freecodecamp HTML and CSS course, having an
          actual tutor, and other students, around was really helpful, and I
          found the foundations module to be a good way to ease myself into the
          routines of night classes twice a week and studying every night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next module was JavaScript basics, and things started to get a
          little more difficult. I had written plenty of functions in JS before
          on freecodecamp and code wars, but I’d never written any tests, or
          built something using JS from scratch! However, being in the same boat
          as a lot of the other students, and having really supportive tutors,
          really helped! Before long I was making my own tamagotchi-style
          virtual pet, which was a lot of fun, and a good chance to put
          everything we had learnt about object oriented programming and test
          driven development to use! The next project was cruise ships which was
          similar to virtual pets in that it uses TDD and OOP, but this time
          there were different classes (objects) which had to interact with one
          another AND there was also the extra challenge of adding a graphical
          user interface as well!
        </p>
        <p>
          Two weeks into the new year and the building blocks module was
          finished, and I had built a website, an application that works on CLI
          as well as another application that has a GUI! There was a weeks
          break, and in that time I decided to start another project called
          across the universe. The idea with this application is that the user
          creates a universe, which contains galaxies, solar systems, planets
          and life! It’s similar to the cruise ships application, as across the
          universe will be using TDD and OOP with multiple classes interacting
          with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which brings us to now, today 3rd Feb 2023. And we’re in the backend
          module. I’m learning lots about docker, containers, SQL, pgAdmin. I’ve
          just finished writing some SQL for some queries on a database, which
          if you asked me to do a week ago, I’d have had no idea what you were
          talking about or where to start (or begin)!
