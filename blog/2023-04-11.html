        <p>The frontend module has been moving along at a frantic pace!</p>
        <p>
          I submitted my weather app for a code review on the 2nd April, and as
          of this morning I've submitted my NASA image search app, too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of the two apps, I would say that the search app was submitted in
          a far better state than the weather app. I rushed the ending of the
          weather app to get the NASA image search app started. This meant that
          the city search in the weather app had a bug where the search request
          is sent to the weather API endpoint every key input. In other words,
          as you type the city you're searching, the app sends that request to
          the weather API e.g. the search requests for Leeds would look like
          "L", "Le", "Lee", "Leed", "Leeds"
        </p>
        <p>So, it works, but in a very buggy way.</p>
        <p>
          Whereas, the NASA app works pretty well! There's a few things I'd like
          to improve, such as having a background for the extended search
          results container, and also the ability to click and see an enlarged
          version of the image.

          Things that I've done other than coding this week include celebrating
          my 31st birthday! This involved a few nice things like going for a
          walk up on the moors around Ilkley on Saturday, eating a lovely
          Italian inspired Sunday roast at Stuzzi and a birthday lunch at SriNon
          Thai yesterday (I had class in the evening!)
