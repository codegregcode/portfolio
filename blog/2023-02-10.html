          When I last posted I was just starting the Backend module with Command
          Shift, and at that point was part way through an exercise using SQL
          and pgAdmin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning SQL meant a lot of retrieving data, updating and adding data
          to databases, joining databases, and to be brutally honest I found it
          a bit boring (even though I know it'll have it's uses). So, I was
          really pleased when we started learning how to create our own APIs
          using express JS!
        </p>
        <p>
          So most of my time this has been spent creating an API that works with
          the code I made way back at the start of the course when first
          learning JavaScript. There's a strange sense of satisfaction when I
          send a get and post request to my server and then receiving the
          (correct) response that my code has generated! Much more exciting than
          SQL!

        <p>
          You can see an example of the API working above. To explain in a bit
          more detail, what I'm doing is sending a 'get' request with the
          parameters (numbers to add or subtract) in the url. Also, please feel
          free to look over the code and even fork/clone over on the

          The first image shows the functions being imported from /lib. In the
          second image you'll see how the express app responds to the request.
          On lines 57 and 58 the variables int1 and int2 take the parameters
          :num1 and :num2 (which are currently strings) and turn them into
          integers. After from lines 60 to 63 we check whether int1 or int2 is
          not a number. isNaN returns true if not a number and using a ternary ?
          expression we say "well if either return true (meaning one or both is
          not a number), then we're going to set teh status to error code 400,
          and send JSON displaying the error message...however...if false...and
          they're both numbers, then we'll set status to 200 (ok) and send JSON
          with the function needed passing in int1 and int2 as the arguments
          required. "

        <p>
          You can see how in the post request we send the arguments in the body
          as JSON.

          And finally here's what's in the numbers.js file in the lib directory!
        </p>
        <p>
          It's been a lot of fun working on the API, and getting stuck in with
          backend coding, so the next thing to do is to send my code for a code
          review, and wait to hear back. I think next week we're starting a
          bigger project using express and postgres, which is about creating a
          music library! But I'm really happy with how the course is going, and
          I'm looking forward to next week! However, as we're moving through the
          backend module, I'm always reminded that I'm heading into the
          'backend' of the course having passed the halfway point :(
