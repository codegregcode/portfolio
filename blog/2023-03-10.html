          There's one friday between this post and my last, and I guess I should
          take that as a sign that I should update this blog fortnightly, rather
          than every week.

          It feels like a lot of time has passed with not all that much change.
          I've been slowly setting up my workspace in my room at home, but it's
          been fairly slow, and quite cold, as the radiator in my room isn't
          working properly at the moment.

          But what I have done is finally finished the Music Library API
          project! I'm really pleased with how it's turned out, especially after
          adding swagger-ui into the project, as it makes interacting with API
          so much easier. I'm hoping that this will look good on my CV!
